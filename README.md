## Behavior

We realized a basic social network based on the most simple features of [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/).

The website permits users management, login, logout, publish posts, put likes, comment posts and follow/unfollow other users.

### Users

A set of data like username, name, surname and credentials that are stored and saved in the social network.

### Login

We used the main techniques for preventing attacks:
- strong passwords support;
- brute force attacks;
- password hashing with random salt both in server and in client-server communication.

### Follow and Unfollow

Every user can follow or unfollow every other user except for himself.

### Posts

They are made of an image and an optional caption that can be of whatever dimension and it adapts dynamically to the screen.

### Comments

These are text messages that can be appended in chronological order to a published post.

### Likes

Posts and comments can be liked, posts like counter is displayed.

### Menu

With a fixed menu, the user can easily navigate troughout the website.

### Explore Searchbar

The explore searchbar allows to find a user by a string-matching research.

### Edit Profile

The user can change his username, name, surname, profile pic and bio. If the user want to change only some of them, the other information remain the same.

## Techniques

We tried to use some of the most advanced techniques for web developing:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS
- PHP
- MySQL
- Apache
- jQuery
- AJAX
